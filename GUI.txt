Nick Valcour, section 106.03

I chose an application theme because those seem to never be very well made, so I made one that, while it technically works, doesn't do it very well

The form lets you add your information for a job(unpaid intern), albeit poorly.

Form1.cs
----------------
-The radio buttons will change their numbers whenever one is chosen to an int between 1 and 100
-the checkboxes will always change to unpaid intern
-the phonenumber section only goes up by one and can't be typed in
-the mail box is unable to be interacted with, leaving it as Mail@mail.mail
-the exit button brings you to FormExit.cs
-The Yes button makes every word "Yes"
-The Next button brings you to FormSubmit.cs


FormExit.cs
----------------
-this.text changes based on your name
-each time you press the yes button, the form changes location on screen and adds a 'really' to the question until you hit 9, then it actually quits
-the no button simply brings you back to Form1.cs


FormSubmit.cs
----------------
-this.text changes basced on your name
-a number 25 digits long is generated on form creation, and you have to type it(can't be copied). if it's correct, when you press confirm you will get a 
messagebox to congragulate you. if it doesn't match, then it will close the FormSubmit.cs and you have to try again with a new number
when you press back it will bring you back to Form1.cs

To stop the form simply go through FormExit, FormSubmit, or Alt+f4
